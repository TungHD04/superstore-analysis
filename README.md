## I. Introduction

This report uses data from Global Superstore to analyze the company's sales performance across various dimensions: region, time, product categories, and customer segments. The goal is to help the business identify strengths, weaknesses, and optimize sales operations. The data includes information on sales, profit, product categories, shipping time, regions, and customer segmentation.

## II. Data Analysis Process
### 1. Data Loading and Exploration
- Dataset: Sample - Superstore.csv (9,994 rows √ó 21 columns)
- The dataset contains transactional records including order details, customer information, sales performance, and shipping data.
- No missing values were found in the dataset, indicating it is complete and ready for analysis.
- Data types were reviewed and adjusted where necessary. Specifically:
    - Order Date and Ship Date columns were converted to appropriate datetime formats for temporal analysis.

### 2. Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
To enhance analytical capabilities, several new features were created:
- Temporal Features:
    - Order Year: Extracted from the Order Date
    - Order Month: Month component of the Order Date
    - Order Day of Week: Day name (e.g., Monday, Tuesday) derived from the Order Date
    - Order YearMonth: Combined year and month in YYYY-MM format for monthly trend analysis
    - Shipping Time: Calculated as the number of days between Ship Date and Order Date, indicating delivery duration
- Standardization:
    - Ensured consistent formatting for string fields (e.g., title-cased category names)
    - Verified and enforced numerical data types for columns such as Sales, Quantity, Discount, and Profit
    - Converted all date-related fields to datetime objects for compatibility with time series functions
